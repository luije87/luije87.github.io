##Introduction

- How many rbi (Runs Batted In) can a player earn in a regular season?

- Which position in the line up could the player fit better in order to help the team to produce more runs? Which means more chance to win

I will be analyzing from my observational data set that I have collected over time from MLB regular seasons 2000-2016. In order to improve my data analysis I excluded pitchers, and players with less than 1000 at bat, also I chose the line up position with the most recurrent position in the past 16 seasons. The line up position is crucial for predicting. It is well known that players from 3 to 6 find more runners in score position than any other line up position.

The result will help scouts and team members to relocate players and predict rbi.

##Knowing the data set

Variables | Description
--- | --- 
player_id | `Player id`
player_name | `Player name`
at_bat | `Number of at bat`
rbi_average | `Total rbi divided by at bat`
hit_average | `Total hits divided by at bat`
line_average | `Total lines divided by at bat`
ground_average | `Total grounds divided by at bat`
fly_average | `Total flies divided by at bat`
strikeout_average | `Total strike outs divided by at bat`
lineup_position | `Most recurrent line up position`

```{r}
path <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luije87/Big-Data-Analysis/master/project.csv"
data <- read.csv(path)
mlb_data <- data[ , c("rbi_average", "hit_average", "line_average", "ground_average", "lineup_position")]
```


```{r, message=FALSE}
attach(mlb_data)
```


```{r}
pairs(mlb_data, pch=16, col="blue")
```
This pairs graph show us the correlation between variables. What I expected : 

- line_average and hit_average to have an strong correletation, meaning the line drive is hardest to catch (more hits) , than grounds and flies in this order.

- lineup_position and rbi_average shows us positions 3, 4, 5 run batters in more than any other line up position.


 Our model will use the following relation:
 
Rbi = ($\beta_0$ + $\beta_1$ * hit_average + $\beta_2$ * line_average + $\beta_3$ * ground_average + $\beta_4$ * lineup_position) * AtBat

```{r}
mlb_model <- lm(rbi_average ~ hit_average + line_average + ground_average + format(lineup_position), data = mlb_data)
```

```{r}
summary(mlb_data)
```

```{r}
summary(mlb_model)
```
The p-values for the selected variables are significants and Adjust R Square is 77%, meaning the model explain 77% the variability of the response around its means.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(mlb_model, which = 1:4)
```

Residual vs Fitted

Observed values are not far away from 0, which means the model fitted well:

residual = observed y - model-predicted y, values should be around 0.

We have three residuals that are away from 0; 67, 83 and 117

Lets predict one of those data points (67), Wilson Ramos, 35 RBI in 2017:

```{r}
predict(mlb_model, list(line_average = 0.14903, ground_average = 0.4735, hit_average = 0.25961, lineup_position = 7)) * 280
```

The prediction for 2017 season is not that close.

Normal Q-Q

Observations lie well along the 45-degree line, so we can asume that normality holds here.

##Season (2017)

I picked 4 players with different positions in the line up and applied the model:

####Yuliesky Gourriel

At Bat : `529`

**RBI** : `75`

Most recurrent line up position : `7`

Variables | Values | Average
--- | --- | ---
Hits | `158` | `0.29867`
Lines Drive | `88` | `0.16635`
Grounds | `218` | `0.41209`

```{r}
predict(mlb_model, list(line_average = 0.16635, ground_average = 0.41209, hit_average = 0.29867, lineup_position = 7)) * 529
```

####Jose Abreu

At Bat : `621`

**RBI** : `102`

Most recurrent line up position : `5`

Variables | Values | Average
--- | --- | ---
Hits | `189` | `0.30434`
Lines Drive | `92` | `0.14814`
Grounds | `229` | `0.36876`

```{r}
predict(mlb_model, list(line_average = 0.14814, ground_average = 0.36876, hit_average = 0.30434, lineup_position = 5)) * 621

```

####Jose Altuve

![J. Altuve](http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/mlb/players/full/31662.png&w=350&h=254 "J. Altuve")

At Bat : `590`

**RBI** : `81`

Most recurrent line up position : `1`

Variables | Values | Average
--- | --- | ---
Hits | `204` | `0.32033`
Lines Drive | `102` | `0.17288`
Grounds | `236` | `0.4`


```{r}
predict(mlb_model, list(line_average = 0.17288, ground_average = 0.4, hit_average = 0.32033, lineup_position = 1)) * 590
```
####Evan Longoria

![E. Longoria](http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/mlb/players/full/28639.png&w=350&h=254 "E. Longoria")

At Bat : `613`

**RBI** : `86`

Most recurrent line up position : `3`

Variables | Values | Average
--- | --- | ---
Hits | `160` | `0.26101`
Lines Drive | `102` | `0.16630`
Grounds | `236` | `0.36541`

```{r}
predict(mlb_model, list(line_average = 0.16630, ground_average = 0.36541, hit_average = 0.26101, lineup_position = 3)) * 613
```

#Conclusion

The predictions for players selected were close to their RBI in 2017. The model works as expected. The baseball game has a lot of stats that can influence our results. I learned we cannot exclude variables we know are important like lineup_position in this case which improved my predictions notably.

I will keep working on this model to improve it to help coaches to find the perfect fit in their line up.
